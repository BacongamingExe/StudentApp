Library of Congress
Volunteer online at By the People, the Library of Congress's crowdsourcing project. By the People invites you to make documents more searchable for everyone by transcribing, reviewing, and tagging digitized images of manuscripts and typed materials from the Library's collections. This work improves search and discovery of this important content.
